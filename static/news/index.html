outward appearance, a <i>lot</i> has changed under the covers.  First, you should notice that the
general appearance is more consistently "Minecraft" in feel, and everything is quite a bit faster.
You should also notice that it works a little bit better on mobile devices (much more on that to
come).  Finally, you'll notice that things are organized a bit better than they have been in the
past.</p><p>If you've used the site before, one thing which has disappeared is the "configure" page.  Now, to
say which mods you're using, just go to the individual mod pages and select the version of that mod
you've got in your mod pack directly. Just as before, the rest of the website will adjust to use the
version you select (or to ignore that mod if you select "no" version).
</p></div></section><section><h3>2016-03-26</h3><div class="panel"><p>The second contribution comes from <a href="http://github.com/kythorn">Jay Oliver</a> who has
added the data files for <a href="/browse/quantum_flux">Quantum Flux</a>. Quantum Flux provides
various items for moving RF power wirelessly and manipulating the flow of time.  It also
provides some pretty powerful powered armor.</p><p>The third contribution, from <a href="http://github.com/ThePsionic">ThePsionic</a>, is a
BuildCraft add-on called <a href="/browse/logistics_pipes">Logistics Pipes</a>.  This mod adds
a whole complex set of pipes which allow automated retrieval, crafting, sorting, and more.
</p></div></section><section><h3>2016-03-25</h3><div class="panel"><p>I've gotten a few contributions of whole mods recently, and I'm catching up on getting them up
on the site.  First up is <a href="/browse/agricraft">Agricraft</a>, contributed by
<a href="http://github.com/dragagon">dragagon</a>!  Agricraft takes the idea of crops from IC2
and pumps it up to a whole new level with a cross-breeding program that introduces a way to grow
anything from native Minecraft flowers all the way up to diamonds!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-02-11</h3><div class="panel"><p>I've been using <a href="/browse/modular_powersuits">Modular PowerSuits</a> myself lately, and I
noticed that the newest version (finally!) comes with default recipes.  So, I've updated
Crafting Guide to support both the newest vanilla recipes as well as those from Thermal
Expansion.  You can switch back and forth on the <a href="/configure">Configure</a> page.
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-02-09</h3><div class="panel"><p>Back before the winter holidays, the extremely patient <a href="https://github.com/tdallmann">
tdallmann</a> completed support for <a href="/browse/hydraulicraft/">Hydraulicraft</a>, and I'm
afraid I'm only now getting it up on the site!  It looks like a neat mod based all around the
science of hydraulics with a nicely stepped set of devices to be made at each level. Many thanks
to tddallmann for adding it to Crafting Guide!</p><p>I also received a submission for adding <a href="/browse/opencomputers">OpenComputers</a> from
<a href="https://github.com/yut23">yut23</a>.  Should be a big help to those aspiring Minecraft
programmers who want a bit more challege than is provided by <a href="/browse/computercraft">
ComputerCraft</a>!  Thanks, yut23!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-25</h3><div class="panel"><p>With many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pkmnfrk">Mike Caron</a>, I'm pleased to announce
support for <a href="/browse/storage_drawers">Storage Drawers</a>!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-12-13</h3><div class="panel"><p>I'm super excited to announce that I've added full multi-block support for Crafting Guide! For
example, check out a <a href="/browse/big_reactors/5_core_passive_reactor">5-Core Reactor</a>
from Big Reactors, or the <a href="/browse/railcraft/steel_tank_5x5x5">5x5x5 Steel Tank</a> from
Railcraft.  I'm really pleased with how it turned out!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-17</h3><div class="panel"><p>And today, it's <a href="/browse/extra_cells">Extra Cells</a>!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-16</h3><div class="panel"><p>It's a small one, but also highly requested...  Here's <a href="/browse/computercraft">ComputerCraft</a>!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-14</h3><div class="panel"><p>One more small one over the weekend... <a href="/browse/advanced_solar_panels">Advanced Solar
Panels</a> has been added to crafting guide!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-14</h3><div class="panel"><p>For a long while now, <a href="/browse/galacticraft">Galacticraft</a> has been the most
requested mod, and it's finally here!  Enjoy!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-10</h3><div class="panel"><p>Remember me?  They guy who runs the site.  Yeah, I'm back, and with big news!  The site now has
a completely new crafting algorithm.  Instead of just taking the first crafting plan it comes up
with, it tries to compute every possible plan, rates them, and then picks the best one.  This
also clears up a lot of bugs related to the old algorithm.  The one drawback is that some items
can take a bit longer to compute than with the old way, but I think you'll find it's worth it!</p><p>On a personal note, I think it's clear that I don't have nearly as much time to dedicate to the
site as I used to.  That's mostly because I started a new job which keeps me away from working
on the site so much.  I hope to be able to get into a more regular pace now things my personal
life has settled down again.</p></div></section></div></div>
