noticed that the newest version (finally!) comes with default recipes.  So, I've updated
Crafting Guide to support both the newest vanilla recipes as well as those from Thermal
Expansion.  You can switch back and forth on the <a href="/configure">Configure</a> page.
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-02-09</h3><div class="panel"><p>Back before the winter holidays, the extremely patient <a href="https://github.com/tdallmann">
tdallmann</a> completed support for <a href="/browse/hydraulicraft/">Hydraulicraft</a>, and I'm
afraid I'm only now getting it up on the site!  It looks like a neat mod based all around the
science of hydraulics with a nicely stepped set of devices to be made at each level. Many thanks
to tddallmann for adding it to Crafting Guide!</p><p>I also received a submission for adding <a href="/browse/opencomputers">OpenComputers</a> from
<a href="https://github.com/yut23">yut23</a>.  Should be a big help to those aspiring Minecraft
programmers who want a bit more challege than is provided by <a href="/browse/computercraft">
ComputerCraft</a>!  Thanks, yut23!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-25</h3><div class="panel"><p>With many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pkmnfrk">Mike Caron</a>, I'm pleased to announce
support for <a href="/browse/storage_drawers">Storage Drawers</a>!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-12-13</h3><div class="panel"><p>I'm super excited to announce that I've added full multi-block support for Crafting Guide! For
example, check out a <a href="/browse/big_reactors/5_core_passive_reactor">5-Core Reactor</a>
from Big Reactors, or the <a href="/browse/railcraft/steel_tank_5x5x5">5x5x5 Steel Tank</a> from
Railcraft.  I'm really pleased with how it turned out!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-17</h3><div class="panel"><p>And today, it's <a href="/browse/extra_cells">Extra Cells</a>!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-16</h3><div class="panel"><p>It's a small one, but also highly requested...  Here's <a href="/browse/computercraft">ComputerCraft</a>!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-14</h3><div class="panel"><p>One more small one over the weekend... <a href="/browse/advanced_solar_panels">Advanced Solar
Panels</a> has been added to crafting guide!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-14</h3><div class="panel"><p>For a long while now, <a href="/browse/galacticraft">Galacticraft</a> has been the most
requested mod, and it's finally here!  Enjoy!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-11-10</h3><div class="panel"><p>Remember me?  They guy who runs the site.  Yeah, I'm back, and with big news!  The site now has
a completely new crafting algorithm.  Instead of just taking the first crafting plan it comes up
with, it tries to compute every possible plan, rates them, and then picks the best one.  This
also clears up a lot of bugs related to the old algorithm.  The one drawback is that some items
can take a bit longer to compute than with the old way, but I think you'll find it's worth it!</p><p>On a personal note, I think it's clear that I don't have nearly as much time to dedicate to the
site as I used to.  That's mostly because I started a new job which keeps me away from working
on the site so much.  I hope to be able to get into a more regular pace now things my personal
life has settled down again.
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-07-25</h3><div class="panel"><p>You may have noticed things have been very quiet with the site for the past month... well I'm
afraid that's because I haven't been working on it.  Instead, I've been hunting for a new job.
Now that I've got that all squared away (I'll be starting at Looker in Santa Cruz on Monday),
I'll have nights and weekends to continue working on the site.  Thanks for being patient!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-06-12</h3><div class="panel"><p>Today I launched the second major part of the item description editor: image uploads! As you
enter your description, use the markdown notation for an image <tt>  ![](image.png)  </tt> and a
empty image preview will show up underneath the editor. Click the button to select an image from
your computer. Just be sure to keep the images to a reasonable size (&lt; 750kB, and &lt; 740px by
600px).
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-05-13</h3><div class="panel"><p>As of today, you can now add and edit item descriptions right on Crafting Guide. This feature is
starting small with just item descriptions, but eventually all the content on the site will be
editable. All you need is a (free) GitHub account, and you're ready to go!</p><p>For those more comfortable with a regular text editor, all the content is still in GitHub under
the <a href="https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide-data">crafting-guide-data</a> repo.
Just follow the instructions, and you can submit content via pull request instead of using the
website's editor.
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-04-30</h3><div class="panel"><p>I've been working on a big new feature for a while now, but I didn't want to leave everyone
without anything new for so long... So, I've just finished adding <a href="/browse/minefactory_reloaded">MineFactory Reloaded</a>! Enjoy!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-04-20</h3><div class="panel"><p>Okay... big changes on the crafting page! Instead of having four little boxes for the various
parts of the crafting plan, the new page shows all the steps as one long list.  In addition, you
get a lot more control over the plan. Now, you can even mark individual steps as complete to get
a new crafting plan which doesn't include those items.</p><p>As an example, let's say you're thinking about upgrading your <a href="/browse/simply_jetpacks/reinforced_jetpack">Reinforced Jetpack</a> to a shiny new <a href="/browse/simply_jetpacks/resonant_jetpack">Resonant Jetpack</a>, you can just mark off the
step for the Reinforced Jetpack, and get only the materials and steps for doing the upgrade.
I'm really pleased with the new crafting page, and I think you're going to love it!
</p></div></section><section><h3>2015-04-11</h3><div class="panel"><p>I've just finished adding <a href="/browse/simply_jetpacks">Simply Jetpacks</a> by Tonius.  It
seems like a simple mod on the surface, but what with all the upgrades and technology tiers, it
takes an amazing <a href="/craft/flux_infused_jetplate">87 steps</a> to make the highest-tier
jetpack!</p><p>I've also added <a href="/browse/solar_flux">Solar Flux</a> by Nauktis. Again, another
deceptively simple mod, but the <a href="/browse/solar_flux/solar_panel_vi/">most powerful solar
panel</a> kicks out an impressive 4096 RF/t! I just hope your mine has been productive... among
other things, you'll need 45 Diamonds, 110 Gold Ore, 1568 Copper Ore, and 6023 Iron Ore!</p></div></section></div></div>
